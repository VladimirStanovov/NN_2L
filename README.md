# NN_2L

This is a C++ implementation of an example code in Octave/Matlab, a neural network with softmax layer for classification.
The Octave/Matlab code was introduced within the Coursera course on Neural Networks for Machine Learning, by University of Toronto, Canada.
More precisely, this example was implemented in week 9, programming assignment 3.
The C++ implementation in CodeBlocks 16.01 was tested to result in exactly the same numbers, as the original Octave/Matlab code.
